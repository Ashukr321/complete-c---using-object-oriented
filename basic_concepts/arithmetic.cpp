// +	Addition	Adds together two values	x + y	
// -	Subtraction	Subtracts one value from another	x - y	
// *	Multiplication	Multiplies two values	x * y	
// /	Division	Divides one value by another	x / y	
// %	Modulus	Returns the division remainder	x % y	
// ++	Increment	Increases the value of a variable by 1	++x	
// --	Decrement	Decreases the value of a variable by 1

// Comparison Operators

// Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.

// The return value of a comparison is either 1 or 0, which means true (1) or false (0). These values are known as Boolean values, and you will learn more about them in the Booleans and If..Else chapter.

// In the following example, we use the greater than operator (>) to find out if 5 is greater than 3


// Operator	Name	Example	Try it
// ==	Equal to	x == y	
// !=	Not equal	x != y	
// >	Greater than	x > y	
// <	Less than	x < y	
// >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
// <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y

// C++ Logical Operators

//Logical Operators
// As with comparison operators, you can also test for true (1) or false (0) values with logical operators.

// Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:

// Operator	Name	Description	Example	Try it
// && 	Logical and	Returns true if both statements are true	x < 5 &&  x < 10	
// || 	Logical or	Returns true if one of the statements is true	x < 5 || x < 4	
// !	Logical not	Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	!(x < 5 && x < 10)
