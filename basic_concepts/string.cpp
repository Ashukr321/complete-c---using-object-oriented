// String Types

// The string type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). This is not a built-in type, but it behaves like one in its most basic usage. String values must be surrounded by double quotes:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    string name = "ashutosh";
    cout << name;
    return 0;
}
